// Refresh the checked-in "latest published release" fact from the real GitHub
// release. The fact is mirrored in three places and ALL must move together:
//
//   web/data/latest-published-release.json   (read by derive-facts.mjs)
//   docs/public-surface-facts.json           (latestPublishedRelease, which
//                                             names the file above as its
//                                             `sources`)
//   docs/cloud-facts/stable.json             (release.latest / release_url,
//                                             compared by check-cloud-facts)
//
// web/lib/public-surface-contract.test.ts asserts the first two agree and
// check-cloud-facts.mjs asserts the third, so updating only one turns a stale
// marketing fact into a red Lint & Type Check. web/lib/facts.generated.ts is
// derived from the first file; regenerate it with derive-facts.mjs afterwards.
//
// release.yml's `sync-release-record` job runs this after every publish and
// proposes the result to main as a bot PR, so nobody hand-commits the record.
//
// Facts must be derivable from the repo with no network (derive-facts.mjs reads
// this file, it does not call GitHub), so the file is checked in. Nothing wrote
// it, which is why it drifted: the marketing deploy's post-deploy comparison
// failed on latestPublishedRelease.tag because this said v0.9.10 while the
// published release was v0.9.11.
//
//   node web/scripts/sync-latest-release.mjs          # write if changed
//   node web/scripts/sync-latest-release.mjs --check  # exit 1 if stale
//
// --check is the CI form: it makes drift a failing gate at PR time instead of a
// surprise after a production deploy. It only warns while the record is exactly
// one release behind a release published under 24h ago: that is the window in
// which release.yml's sync-release-record PR is waiting to merge, and neither a
// PR author nor an unrelated push to main can fix it. Past 24h, or more than one
// release behind, it fails again.
